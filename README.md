## Silly Story Generator

This generates a silly story when the "Generate random story" button is pressed. 

It replaces the default name "Bob" in the story with a custom name, only if a custom name is entered into the "Enter custom name" text field before the generate button is pressed. 

It also converts the default US weight and temperature quantities and units in the story into UK equivalents if the UK radio button is checked before the generate button is pressed. 

A random story will be generated if you press the button again (and again...)
